Hi A.G., I am kicking the tires. 

Let's see if I understand how to add images...
I am going to add an image titled kitty.png to the public/assets/images/posts folder.

Then I am going to reference this image using markdown below... Let's see if this works?!

![Error](@@baseUrl@@/assets/images/posts/kitty.png)

Nice!

Okay, Feel free to use this as a reference for your future posts. Remember, you are writing markdown so don't worry about formatting or any restrictions. I used markdown formatting to bold the text below.

__Note: NPM has realtime/responsive editing. Hitting 'save' will recompile the package. Feel free to edit the markdown file, hit save, and reload your broswer to see any changes.__
